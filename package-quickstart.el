(autoload 'reformatter-define "reformatter" "\
Define a reformatter command with NAME.

When called, the reformatter will use PROGRAM and any ARGS to
reformat the current buffer.  The contents of the buffer will be
passed as standard input to the reformatter, which should output
them to standard output.  A nonzero exit code will be reported as
failure, and the output of the command to standard error will be
displayed to the user.

The macro accepts the following keyword arguments:

PROGRAM (required)

  Provides a form which should evaluate to a string at runtime,
  e.g. a literal string, or the name of a variable which holds
  the program path.

ARGS

  Command-line arguments for the program.  If provided, this is a
  form which evaluates to a list of strings at runtime.  Default
  is the empty list.  This form is evaluated at runtime so that
  you can use buffer-local variables to influence the args passed
  to the reformatter program: the variable `input-file' will be
  lexically bound to the path of a file containing the text to be
  reformatted: see the keyword options INPUT-FILE, STDIN and
  STDOUT for more information.

STDIN

  When non-nil (the default), the program is passed the input
  data on stdin.  Set this to nil when your reformatter can only
  operate on files in place.  In such a case, your ARGS should
  include a reference to the `input-file' variable, which will be
  bound to an input path when evaluated.

STDOUT

  When non-nil (the default), the program is expected to write
  the reformatted text to stdout.  Set this to nil if your
  reformatter can only operate on files in place, in which case
  the contents of the temporary input file will be used as the
  replacement text.

INPUT-FILE

  Sometimes your reformatter program might expect files to be in
  a certain directory or have a certain file extension.  This option
  lets you handle that.

  If provided, it is a form which will be evaluated before each
  run of the formatter, and is expected to return a temporary
  file path suitable for holding the region to be reformatted.
  It must not produce the same path as the current buffer's file
  if that is set: you shouldn't be operating directly on the
  buffer's backing file.  The temporary input file will be
  deleted automatically.  You might find the functions
  `reformatter-temp-file-in-current-directory' and
  `reformatter-temp-file' helpful.

MODE

  Unless nil, also generate a minor mode that will call the
  reformatter command from `before-save-hook' when enabled.
  Default is t.

GROUP

  If provided, this is the custom group used for any generated
  modes or custom variables.  Don't forget to declare this group
  using a `defgroup' form.

LIGHTER

  If provided, this is a mode lighter string which will be used
  for the \"-on-save\" minor mode.  It should have a leading
  space.  The supplied value will be used as the default for a
  generated custom variable which specifies the mode lighter.
  Default is nil, ie. no lighter.

KEYMAP

  If provided, this is the symbol name of the \"-on-save\" mode's
  keymap, which you must declare yourself.  Default is no keymap.

EXIT-CODE-SUCCESS-P

  If provided, this is a function object callable with `funcall'
  which accepts an integer process exit code, and returns non-nil
  if that exit code is considered successful.  This could be a
  lambda, quoted symbol or sharp-quoted symbol.  If not supplied,
  the code is considered successful if it is `zerop'.

Which set of key bindings to add to the global keymap, if any.

This option controls which set of Magit key bindings, if any, may

the current Emacs session.

If the value is nil, no bindings are added.

If `default', maybe add:

    C-x g     `magit-status'
    C-x M-g   `magit-dispatch'
    C-c M-g   `magit-file-dispatch'

    These bindings are strongly recommended, but we cannot use
    them by default, because the \"C-c <LETTER>\" namespace is
    strictly reserved for bindings added by the user.

The bindings in the chosen set may be added when
`after-init-hook' is run.  Each binding is added if, and only
if, at that time no other key is bound to the same command,
and no other command is bound to the same key.  In other words
we try to avoid adding bindings that are unnecessary, as well
as bindings that conflict with other bindings.

Adding these bindings is delayed until `after-init-hook' is
run to allow users to set the variable anywhere in their init
file (without having to make sure to do so before `magit' is
loaded or autoloaded) and to increase the likelihood that all
the potentially conflicting user bindings have already been
added.

To set this variable use either `setq' or the Custom interface.
Do not use the function `customize-set-variable' because doing
that would cause Magit to be loaded immediately, when that form
is evaluated (this differs from `custom-set-variables', which
doesn't load the libraries that define the customized variables).

Toggle Iedit mode.
This command behaves differently, depending on the mark, point,
prefix argument and variable `iedit-transient-mark-sensitive'.

If Iedit mode is off, turn Iedit mode on.

When Iedit mode is turned on, all the occurrences of the current
region in the buffer (possibly narrowed) or a region are
highlighted.  If one occurrence is modified, the change are
propagated to all other occurrences simultaneously.

If region is not active, `iedit-default-occurrence' is called to
get an occurrence candidate, according to the thing at point.  It
might be url, email address, markup tag or current symbol(or
word).

In the above two situations, with digit prefix argument 0, only
occurrences in current function are matched.  This is good for
renaming refactoring in programming.

You can also switch to Iedit mode from isearch mode directly. The
current search string is used as occurrence.  All occurrences of
the current search string are highlighted.

With an universal prefix argument, the occurrence when Iedit mode
is turned off last time in current buffer is used as occurrence.
This is intended to recover last Iedit mode which is turned off.
If region active, Iedit mode is limited within the current
region.

With repeated universal prefix argument, the occurrence when
Iedit mode is turned off last time (might be in other buffer) is
used as occurrence.  If region active, Iedit mode is limited
within the current region.

With digital prefix argument 1, Iedit mode is limited on the
current symbol or the active region, which means just one
instance is highlighted.  This behavior serves as a start point
of incremental selection work flow.

If Iedit mode is on and region is active, Iedit mode is
restricted in the region, e.g. the occurrences outside of the
region is excluded.

If Iedit mode is on and region is active, with an universal
prefix argument, Iedit mode is restricted outside of the region,
e.g. the occurrences in the region is excluded.

Search with `grep' for files in DIR where the content matches a regexp.

The initial input is given by the INITIAL argument.  DIR can be
nil, a directory string or a list of file/directory paths.  If
`consult-grep' is called interactively with a prefix argument,
the user can specify the directories or files to search in.
Multiple directories must be separated by comma in the
minibuffer, since they are read via `completing-read-multiple'.
By default the project directory is used if
`consult-project-function' is defined and returns non-nil.
Otherwise the `default-directory' is searched.

The input string is split, the first part of the string (grep
input) is passed to the asynchronous grep process and the second
part of the string is passed to the completion-style filtering.

The input string is split at a punctuation character, which is
given as the first character of the input string.  The format is
similar to Perl-style regular expressions, e.g., /regexp/.
Furthermore command line options can be passed to grep, specified
behind --.  The overall prompt input has the form
`#async-input -- grep-opts#filter-string'.

Note that the grep input string is transformed from Emacs regular
expressions to Posix regular expressions.  Always enter Emacs
regular expressions at the prompt.  `consult-grep' behaves like
builtin Emacs search commands, e.g., Isearch, which take Emacs
regular expressions.  Furthermore the asynchronous input split
into words, each word must match separately and in any order.
See `consult--regexp-compiler' for the inner workings.  In order
to disable transformations of the grep input, adjust
`consult--regexp-compiler' accordingly.

Here we give a few example inputs:

#alpha beta         : Search for alpha and beta in any order.
#alpha.*beta        : Search for alpha before beta.
#\\(alpha\\|beta\\) : Search for alpha or beta (Note Emacs syntax!)
#word -- -C3        : Search for word, include 3 lines as context
#first#second       : Search for first, quick filter for second.
